        <p className="mt-2 mb-7">
          The Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge consists of a dataset
          and evaluation to enable research in music recommendations. It is a
          continuation of the RecSys Challenge 2018, which ran from January to
          July 2018. The dataset contains 1,000,000 playlists, including
          playlist titles and track titles, created by users on the Spotify
          platform between January 2010 and October 2017. The evaluation task is
          automatic playlist continuation: given a seed playlist title and/or
          initial set of tracks in a playlist, to predict the subsequent tracks
          in that playlist. This is an open-ended challenge intended to
          encourage research in music recommendations, and no prizes will be
          awarded (other than bragging rights).
